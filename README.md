# InterSystems IRIS Container Tools
This repository contains Dockerfiles and other associated tools for customers
who want to build OCI-compliant images for InterSystems IRIS.  The "official"
folders contain the steps used by InterSystems to build the images we ship,
and are intended to be a best practice guide for customers who want to take
steps towards building their own images.

This repository does not contain source or binaries for iris-main.  To build
images with iris-main, copy it from the released image of InterSystems IRIS for
the version you are working with, or download it from the InterSystems WRC.

For more extensive documentation on using InterSystems IRIS in container form,
please see:  https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=ADOCK
